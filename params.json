{"name":"Philips Hue SDK - Java Multi-Platform","tagline":"Java Multi-Platform and Android SDK (beta)","body":"### Introduction to the Java Multi-Platform and Android SDK\r\nThe Java Hue SDK is a set of tools that are designed to make it easy to access the Hue system through the Hue Wi-Fi network connected bridge and control an associated set of connected lamps. The aim of the SDK is to enable you to create your own applications for the Hue system. The tools are provided with documentation for the SDK and example code.   \r\n   \r\n      \r\nTo develop for Hue you require the Philips Hue Personal Wireless Lighting System.\r\n\r\n### Platform Independent\r\nThe Java SDK is platform independent so it will run on any Java Desktop/Android environment.  It has been successfully tested on Windows, Linux, OS X and Android (including Libgdx and OUYA, an Android gaming console).\r\n\r\n### Example Source Code\r\nThere are currently 3 sample apps with source code, which demonstrate how to use the SDK:\r\n\r\n* **Quick Start App**  A bare bones Android app with minimal code for connecting to a bridge. A good starting point for creating your own hue app.\r\n* **Sample App**       A larger example Android app showing more functionality, for example, lights, groups, scenes and schedules. \r\n* **Desktop App**      A Java Desktop/Application written in Swing with minimal code for connecting to a bridge and changing your lights.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nFor an explanation of the key concepts and how to use the SDK, please refer to the Android README.  If you wish to develop for other platforms the core concepts are the same.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PhilipsHue/PhilipsHueSDK-Java-MultiPlatform-Android/blob/master/README.md\r\n\r\nFor further developer information please visit:\r\n\r\nhttp://developers.meethue.com \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble developing for Hue?  Any problems please raise an issue on GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"38119518-2","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
